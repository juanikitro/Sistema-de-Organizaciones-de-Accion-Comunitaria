# Sistema-de-Organizaciones-de-Accion-Comunitaria

## Why?

This is my bigger real project. The goal was to create a system that will help "General Directorate of Community Relations" to organize the actions of the community.

This is my first and my last Django project for the moment.

I want to public it because I enjoied a lot doing it and I am not working more for the government, so I can, but you can't view the deployed version because is private.
